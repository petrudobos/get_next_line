# get_next_line

**A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.**

## Foreword

Get_next_line is a programming assignment for first year students at Academy+Plus.

get_next_line basically reads a file line by line.

Disclaimer: *There [are][10] [so][11] [many][12] [easier][13] methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my [libft][14] and only the standard functions `read`, `malloc` and `free`.*
