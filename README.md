# get_next_line

**A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.**

## Foreword

Get_next_line is a programming assignment for first year students at Academy+Plus.

Get_next_line will allow you to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor, similarly to the getline(3) function.

Disclaimer: *There [are][2] [so][3] [many][4] [easier][5] methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my [libft][6] and only the standard functions `read`, `malloc` and `free`.*

More details included in the [get_next_line.en.pdf][1] file.
